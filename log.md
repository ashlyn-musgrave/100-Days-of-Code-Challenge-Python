# 100 days of code challenge

#### Day 1: November 15, 2022

##### **Today's Progress:** Today I created a madlibs game in which I practiced with the Python string format() method. 

##### **Thoughts:** Although a simple and rather non-ambitious game, I felt that this was a good starting point to dip my toes into the 100 days of coding challenge. I could make this more complicated by adding in some conditions when asking for user input such as capitalization or making the term being plural.
