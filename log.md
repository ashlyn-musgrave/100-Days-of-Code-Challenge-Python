# 100 days of code challenge

#### Day 1: November 15, 2022

##### **Today's Progress:** Today I created a madlibs game in which I practiced with the Python string format() method. 

##### **Thoughts:** Although a simple and rather non-ambitious game, I felt that this was a good starting point to dip my toes into the 100 days of coding challenge. I could make this more complicated by adding in some conditions when asking for user input such as capitalization or making the term plural.

#### Day 2: November 16, 2022

##### **Today's Progress:** Today I followed along with two YouTube videos where I programmed a guessing game and quiz game. I practiced with the randint() function as well as while loops and functions. 

##### **Thoughts:** I was starting to get frustrated when coding the guessing game because I wasn't able to fully understand why certain variables needed to be defined and in what order. I would say I have about 90% comprehension of the guessing game but 100% comprehension of the quiz game. I was having a little trouble understanding why I was getting wrong answers with the quiz game, but I think it was an issue with the .lower() function. Once I lowercased the answer to the question in my code, it seemed to work correctly when I ran the script

#### Day 3: November 17, 2022

##### **Today's Progress:** Today I re-coded the guessing game from yesterday by following along with a different YouTube video that made more sense to me. I also coded a rock/paper/scissors game against the computer. Both games were successful!

##### **Thoughts:** I wanted to re-code the guessing game from yesterday using a different methodology and it was much more logical than my previous attempt. I can confidently say that I 100% understand the logic behind the code. I'm starting to learn that even with code, you can arrive to the same output differently than other programmers.
