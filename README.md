# 100 Days of Code Challenge
100 Days of Code Challenge 

I'm embarking on my 100 days of code challenge on November 15, 2022 

**Intention:** The purpose of embarking on this challenge is to improve my Python programming skills in order to become a better cloud engineer.

**Challenge Outline:** For the first 30 days of this challenge, I plan to follow increasing difficult coding tutorials on YouTube to establish my foundation and to become intimatly familiar with uploading my progress to GitHub. Depending on my confidence level after the first 30 days, I would like to dive into a cloud related project to start building my portfolio and increasing my knowledge of programming services and features for the cloud. 

**Rules:** 

     1. Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
     2. Tweet my progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag (@ashlynintech)
     3. Update my GitHub repo daily with my progress
